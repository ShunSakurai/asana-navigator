<h4>Updates</h4>
<p>Thank you for using Asana Navigator!<br>
I made an important update. Please reload the Asana task page if this extension doesn't work well just after the update.</p>
<p>I made the following two changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new feature is added to jump to any other sibling subtasks. You can now display a drop-down list containing all subtasks of the parent task.</li>
  <li>The keyboard shortcut <strong>Tab+K</strong> (go to previous subtask) is changed to <strong>Tab+G</strong>. It's because Tab+K is now used to like/heart the task.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Contact</h4>
