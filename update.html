<h4>Asana Navigator Updates</h4>
<p>Thank you for using Asana Navigator!<br>
I made an update. Please reload the Asana task page if this extension doesn't work well just after the update.</p>
<p>I made the following change:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pressing the keyboard shortcut <strong>Tab+E</strong> or clicking [More actions (...)] > [Replace Text in Description...] now opens a dialog view which allows you to see what you are replacing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Contact</h4>
<p>My name is Shun Sakurai, an amateur programmer. I'd love to hear from users and developers to learn more about programming and create better tools.</p>
