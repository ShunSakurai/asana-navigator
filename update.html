<h4>Asana Navigator Updates</h4>
<p>Thank you for using Asana Navigator!<br>
I made some important updates. Please reload the Asana task page if this extension doesn't work well just after the update.</p>
<p>I made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pressing the keyboard shortcut <strong>Tab+E</strong> or clicking [More actions (...)] > [Replace Text in Description...] now opens a dialog view which allows you to see what you are replacing.</li>
  <li>Added the feature to replace cutom text in the task description. It's also accessible through the keyboard shortcut <strong>Tab+E</strong> or by clicking [More actions (...)] > [Replace Text in Description...].</li>
</ul>
